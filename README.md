### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**sarah-mirr/sarah-mirr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello! I am Sarah and I am currently working at Flywheel as a data analyst! I started as an intern in 2021 and worked thorugh my last year and a half of college until joining fulltime in December of 2022! 
I have really enjoyed expanding my knowledge in python, aws, airflow astronomer, sql, amazon and much more. I am learning everyday and looking forward to continue my growth as a data anlyst and hopefully data 
engineer in the future. My favorite part about what I do is collobarating and working with my teammates. After 4.5 years of collegiate soccer (thanks to covid) I love being back in a team setting!

When I am not working you can find me at the gym or on the soccer field. I am passionate about soccer and spend my free time playing games, playing futsal, or coaching! My favorite premier league team is Arsenal (GO GUNNERS!)
And my favorite international team is Brazil and favorite player is Neymar but of course its a given that I am TEAM MESSI! I currently live in California and love to try new foods and explore the different beauties my current
life has to offer!
